# Decoding-of-Aircraft-signals

ADS â€“ B, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast is a surveillance method by which aircraft and other aerodrome vehicles communicate with each other. This technology enables an aircraft to periodically broadcast its position information (altitude, GPS coordinates, heading, etc.) using the Mode-S signaling scheme. The python code was built to demonstrate the working of an ADS-B decoder. It takes two signals as input (i.e the signal received and the previous signal) and provides details such as latitude, logitude, altitude, ground speed, ascending rate and airspeed.
